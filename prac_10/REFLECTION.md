# Reflection
Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

Regarding estimation for practical tasks, My time estimation was not accurate at the beginning of the study period, but as time passed, I began
to understand more on how I work through the code and create program. As a result, the accuracy had improved compared to previous estimation.

Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

Regarding code reviews, while doing reviews,I have learned that the same outcome could be achieved using different methods, there are more than one way to code.
As I am being reviewed, I have learned that I still need to keep studying and practising to improve my program structure. Additionally, I also 
learned from mistakes and were able to improve my logic in coding. 

Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Regarding the practical tasks overall, I would add more exercises for association and inheritance.
